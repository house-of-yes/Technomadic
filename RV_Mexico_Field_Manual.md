# RV Mexico Field Manual
_A comprehensive guide to long-stay, low-cost RV living across Mexico (32‑ft motorhome friendly)_

---

## 0) Snapshot — What to Expect
- **Monthly site cost (typical):** USD $250–$600 (basic to full hookups, location-dependent). Prime beachfront tourist zones can exceed $600; rural/longer-term deals can fall near $250–$350.
- **Best-value regions:** Northern Baja (outside resort strips), Bahía Concepción/Mulegé corridor, La Paz outskirts, Mazatlán area, Manzanillo–Barra de Navidad, parts of Oaxaca coast, Yucatán west coast (Progreso/Chicxulub).
- **Paperwork:** FMM (tourist card) up to 180 days; **TIP** (vehicle import permit) required for mainland Mexico (not required for Baja and the Sonora Free Zone); valid passport; Mexican liability insurance.
- **Safety:** Favor established RV parks and well-reviewed private lots. Travel during daylight, use toll roads (cuota) when practical, and avoid isolated overnights unless recommended by locals.
- **Connectivity:** Telcel prepaid with hotspot usually the simplest. Starlink works in many regions; verify current service terms and price before relying on it.
- **Rig size:** 32‑ft is workable in most RV parks and many private lots; tight colonial streets can be challenging. Plan approach routes.

- **Fuel:** Pemex plus private brands; pay attention to gas vs. diesel labeling; keep small bills.
- **Breakdowns:** Larger cities (Ensenada, La Paz, Mazatlán, PV, Mérida) have better parts/service networks.

## 9) Finding Spots & Making Arrangements
