# RV Parking Field Manual
_A working guide for low-cost, lawful, and sustainable living in a 32-ft motorhome_

---

## 1. Northern California Overview

### Vallejo
- **Tradewinds RV Park** — $858–$983 + electric. Clean, fenced, long-term legal base inside city limits.  
- **Vallejo Mobile Home Community** — around $895/month + utilities. Stable but slightly higher cost.  
- **Street parking:** Vallejo actively enforces overnight bans; towing risk for static RVs.  
- **Verdict:** Safest legal base near Bay under $1,000 but still over half of a fixed income.

### Benicia
- **East N Street Trailer Park** — $475–$725 (includes utilities). Small, older, month-to-month friendly. Best current value in the region.  
- **Tone:** Modest, quiet, mixed tenants, long-term possible.  
- **Verdict:** Lead contender for affordability and legality within commuting distance.

### Fairfield
- **Fairfield Mobile Home & RV Park** — about $895/month. Legitimate, family-run, full hookups.  
- **Verdict:** Practical backup when Benicia is full.

### Delta Corridor (Rio Vista, Isleton)
- **Delta Marina RV Park** — weeklies $387–$450, 2-week max.  
- **Delta Shores Resort & Marina** — monthlies around $1,000 + deposit.  
- **Verdict:** Cheap short-stay respites; isolation and limits prevent permanence.

## 2. Wider-Range Possibilities

### Berkeley / East Bay
- Code §14.72.130 forbids vehicle habitation, but enforcement is complaint-driven.  
- **BART lots** post “no overnight” yet tolerate day parking.  
- **UC lots** (e.g., Berkeley Law park-and-ride) fall under campus police; overnight risk is warnings, not tow.  
- **Tactic:** Rotate positions, arrive late, leave early. Low visibility = low friction.

### Santa Barbara — New Beginnings Safe Parking
- Nonprofit overnight program for vehicles under 25 ft.  
- Focus on transition to housing; **no large RVs**.  
- Useful only for temporary respite.

### Central & Southern California
- Coastal parks rarely below $1,000/month.  
- Inland desert zones drop to $500–$700 but distant from services.  
- Enforcement heavier in tourist counties (Santa Cruz, San Diego).

### Oregon / Nevada / Colorado
- **Oregon:** Around Bend — ample BLM land, legal dispersed camping up to 14 days, often free.  
- **Nevada:** Near Pahrump or Vegas — private parks $400–$700 with hookups; safe desert boondocking legal.  
- **Colorado:** Public-land camping plentiful, though winter elevation limits use.  
- **Verdict:** Excellent for seasonal migration if travel feasible.

### Mexico
- **Northern Baja:** Beachside RV parks $250–$450 USD/month, basic amenities, lenient rules.  
- **Mainland (Mazatlán → Puerto Vallarta):** $300–$600/month depending on hookups.  
- **Visa:** 180-day FMM tourist card renewable by border run.  
- **Safety:** Generally good in established RV zones; heed local guidance.

### El Salvador
- **Modest apartments / beach bungalows:** $300–$600 USD/month.  
- Infrastructure improving; foreign RV storage limited, but rental living inexpensive.  
- **Currency:** USD — no exchange risk.  
- **Verdict:** Viable base if rig sold or stored stateside.

## 3. Short-Term & Tactical Options

### Private Lot Arrangements
- Approach owners directly; describe as **paid storage**, not residence.  
- Key phrases: *self-contained*, *insured*, *quiet*, *no utilities needed*.  
- Typical private-lot rate: $150–$400 depending on access.  
- Handshake or one-page memo avoids tenancy issues.

### Craigslist Outreach
**Goal:** Two solid email leads per day.  
**Best categories:** *Parking & Storage* and *Housing Wanted.*  
**Template:**

> **Title:** Quiet 32-ft motorhome seeks safe monthly parking — respectful, self-contained  
>
> Hello, I’m looking for a spot to park and live quietly in a 32-ft motorhome.  
> • Fully self-contained (no hookups needed)  
> • Non-smoker, no noise, no traffic  
> • Flexible on location — Santa Cruz ↔ Sebastopol ↔ East Bay  
> • Prefer private lot, yard, or rural drive with space to turn around  
> • Open to short-term, month-to-month, or caretaking arrangements  
>
> Happy to contribute rent or barter for light maintenance — open to discuss.  
> If you have room or know someone who might, please email details (location, access, rate).  
>
> Thank you for reading — I respond quickly and can meet in person.

**Posting tips:**
- Do not list a price; flexibility invites higher offers.  
- Refresh every 48 hours in multiple regions.  
- Use a neutral email handle (no “RV” or “homeless” keywords).  
- Photos optional — can share privately after first contact.

## 4. Interim & Free Options

### Boondocking
- Rotate between legal pullouts, trailheads, and rural roads.  
- Never exceed posted limits; keep low profile.  
- Solar + battery setup vital; quiet hours = invisibility.

### Safe Parking Programs
- Structured lots run by nonprofits or cities.  
- Usually limit to cars/vans; sometimes accept small Class C RVs.  
- Free, supervised, includes outreach support.

## 5. Beyond Survival — Guiding Principles

1. **Discretion = Freedom.** A tidy, polite presence buys more time than any permit.  
2. **Flexibility = Currency.** Those who can move win the best spaces.  
3. **Respect = Longevity.** Thank the owner, keep the lot clean, pay on time.  
4. **Documentation.** Keep copies of agreements and insurance; it defuses enforcement.  
5. **Community.** Share intel with other travelers; co-adventurers turn leads into lifelines.  
6. **Financial Reality.** Bay-Area legal parking rarely below $475/month; $900+ typical. Budget for fuel and movement.  
7. **Vision.** This is not camping — it’s portable sovereignty.
